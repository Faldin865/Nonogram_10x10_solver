# Falcross_Solver

Work in progress of a Falcross ( 10x10 at the moment) Solver in C.

The Basic rule of 10 is handle right now, the real fun part start now !

If you are interested in the project you can always copy the repo and work on it !


To do list :

-Handle visual recognition of the board ( exterior numbers, size of the board) at the moment it works with the argv
-Handle a basic 10x10 board with the minimum of random in the solve process
-Handle various size boards ( 5x5 to 25x25) some changes to the code will be needed at this point
-Work with an android emulator to auto complete and send the input of the solved board to the game
-Many more things I haven't think about yet
