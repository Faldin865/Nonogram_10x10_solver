# Falcross_Solver

Work in progress of a Falcross ( 10x10 at the moment) Solver in C.

The Basic rule of 10 is handle right now, the real fun part start now !

If you are interested in the project you can always copy the repo and work on it !


To do list :

-Handle visual recognition of the board ( exterior numbers, size of the board) at the moment it works with the argv

-Handle a basic 10x10 board with the minimum of random in the solve process

-Handle various size boards ( 5x5 to 25x25) some changes to the code will be needed at this point

-Work with an android emulator to auto complete and send the input of the solved board to the game

-Many more things I haven't think about yet


Example of input to try the program :

14@51@6@13@1141@3211@13@116@11211@63 133@211@133@111@63@116@1111@36@121@16 @

(@ is the separator)

It's a 10x10 board

For the visual of it go to the img folder, you will see the original board and my progress at the moment.
